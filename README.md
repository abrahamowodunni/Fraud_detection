### Feature Engineering 🛠️
- **Data Preparation:** Remove unnecessary features like `Trans_date_trans_time`, `Cc_num`, `First`, `Last`, `Gender`, `Street`, `State`, `City`, `Zipcode`, `Trans_num`, and convert `DoB` into categorical age groups.
- **Data Scaling:** Apply label encoding and scaling to numerical data for model compatibility.

### Choice of Model 🤖
To address fraud detection efficiently:
- **Criteria:** Prioritize models based on speed, interpretability, and appropriate metrics (accuracy, F1 score, AUC).
- **Metric Emphasis:** Focus on recall and precision for comprehensive fraud detection without disrupting legitimate transactions.

### Customer Perspective 🧑‍💼
- **Trust and Security:** Ensure high recall to detect most fraud cases.
- **Minimal Disruption:** Maintain high precision to minimize false positives and customer inconvenience.
- **Balanced Approach:** Aim for a balanced F1 score to foster customer loyalty and confidence.

### Modularized Code Structure 📦
- **Version Control:** Utilize Git and GitHub Actions for version control and CI/CD pipelines.
- **Virtual Environment:** Use virtual environments for package management and dependency isolation.
- **Project Template:** Streamline project setup with templates for initial files and folders.
- **Setup.py:** Manage project metadata, dependencies, packaging, and installation processes.

### Additional Considerations 🌐
- **Merchant Impact:** Consider impacts on merchants due to fraud, including refunds and product losses.
- **Fraud Type Analysis:** Incorporate data on fraud methods (e.g., lost or stolen card, identity theft, skimming) to enhance detection strategies.
